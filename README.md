# my_stl
- I wrote my own library that implements the main standard C++ container classes: list, map, queue, set, stack, vector, array, multiset. The implementation includes the entire set of standard methods and attributes for working with elements, checking if the container is full, and iterating. As an additional task, it is proposed to implement several more not so often used, but differing in implementation details, container classes from the C++ container library.
